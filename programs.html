<h3 class="sectitle">bayesdtm: A Bayesian Decision-Theoretic Model to Compute Expected Losses with and without an Intervention</h3>
Near completion

<p>
This package implements a Bayesian decision-theoretic model to compute expected losses given an intervention (in causal inference senses) and those without it, and returns the plot of these expected losses (currently available only for outputs from a Bayesian logistic regression).
