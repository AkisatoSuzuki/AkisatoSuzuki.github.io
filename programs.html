<h3 class="sectitle">bayesdtm: A Bayesian Decision-Theoretic Model to Compute Expected Losses with and without an Intervention</h3>
Current version: 0.0.0.9001<br>
<a href="bayesdtm.html">Vignette</a>

<p>
This package implements a Bayesian decision-theoretic model to compute expected losses given an intervention (in causal inference senses) and those without it across different ratios of the cost of the intervention to the cost of the status quo, and returns the plot of these expected losses (currently available only for outputs from a Bayesian logistic regression). For details on how to install and use the package, please see the <a href="bayesdtm.html">vignette</a>.

<h3 class="sectitle">ccdfpost: Plot a Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function for the Posterior Samples of a Causal Effect</h3>
Current version: 0.0.0.9001<br>
<a href="ccdfpost.html">Vignette</a>

<p>
This function produces the plot of a complementary cumulative distribution function for the posterior samples of a causal effect. For details on how to install and use the package, please see the <a href="ccdfpost.html">vignette</a>.
