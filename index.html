<p class="whatsnew">
I just updated the top page a little bit.
</p>

<p>
Welcome! I am half a data scientist and half a political scientist, being interested in applying Bayesian statistics, causal inference, and decision theory to find a solution to decision problems.
</p>

<p>
I was an Irish Research Council Government of Ireland Postdoctoral Fellow at the School of Politics and International Relations, University College Dublin, from 2018-20. I was a Max Weber Fellow at the European University Institute from 2016-18. I obtained my PhD from Dublin City University in 2015.
