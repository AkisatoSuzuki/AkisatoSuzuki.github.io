<p>
Welcome! I am half a data scientist and half a political scientist and interested in public policy analysis, Bayesian statistics, causal inference, and decision theory.
</p>

<p>
I am currently an Adjunct Research Fellow with the School of Politics and International Relations, University College Dublin. I was an Irish Research Council Government of Ireland Postdoctoral Fellow at the same School from 2018-20. I was a Max Weber Fellow at the European University Institute from 2016-18. I obtained my PhD from Dublin City University in 2015.

This website introduces some of my research. Obviously, the views expressed are my own unless otherwise stated, and do not necessarily represent those of the organizations/institutes to which I am/have been related.
