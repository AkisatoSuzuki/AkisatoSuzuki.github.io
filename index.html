<p class="whatsnew">
The working paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10903" target="_blank">"Policy Implications of Statistical Estimates: A General Bayesian Decision-Theoretic Model for Binary Outcomes"</a> is out in arXiv now. The accompanying R package <a href="bayesdtm.html">bayesdtm</a> is also out.

I am half a data scientist and half a political scientist, being interested in applying Bayesian statistics, causal inference, and decision theory to find a solution to decision problems. I am currently an Irish Research Council Government of Ireland Postdoctoral Fellow at the School of Politics and International Relations, University College Dublin. I was a Max Weber Fellow at the European University Institute from 2016-18. I obtained my PhD from Dublin City University in 2015.
