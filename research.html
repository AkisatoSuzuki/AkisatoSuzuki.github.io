<h3 class="sectitle">Bayesian Causal Inference (provisional title)</h3>
Status: proposal stage

<p>
This project aims to develop a Bayesian framework for causal inference that is easy for applied researchers to use and interpret.
</p>

<h3 class="sectitle">Robust Statistical Decision Making for Policy and Politics</h3>
Status: dissemination stage

<p>
This project developed new approaches to understanding and communicating the uncertainty of statistically estimated causal effects. To this end, the project took advantage of Bayesian statistics and decision theory. The project was funded by the Irish Research Council under research grant GOIPD/2018/328.

<h3 class="sectitle">Citizens, Leaders, and War</h3>
Status: ongoing

<p>
    This project develops a new theory of why citizens allow their leaders to go to war, if war is <i>ex post</i> inefficient for the entire society. I run a Monte Carlo analysis to simulate under what conditions the public is more likely to form an anti-war protest.

<h3 class="sectitle">Nationalism, Rivalry, and Revisionist State Behavior: A New Theory and Empirics in the Post-WWII Era (PhD thesis)</h3>
Status: finished

<p>
    Drawing on theories of nationalism and interstate rivalry, the thesis develops a new theory of nationalistic rivalry, i.e., a specific type of rivalry where dispute-prone states perceive each other as threatening and competing enemies due to a nationalist issue. Building on original data of nationalistic-rivalry dyads from 1946-2001, the thesis examines the validity of nationalistic rivalry theory through the combination of large-N statistical analysis and small-N case studies. It finds that nationalistic rivalry significantly increases the probability of revisionist foreign policy, and thwarts the effect of well-known conflict-mitigating factors. The literature has found that nationalism is a major cause of conflict. However, it is little known whether nationalism in the context of interstate politics increases revisionist state behavior specifically. While revisionist states have often been nationalistic (e.g., Imperial Japan or Milosevic Serbia), nationalism is not always revisionistic (e.g., the UK at the time of the Falklands War). What conditions cause nationalism to be a force of revisionist behavior? The thesis answers this question by explaining how nationalist politics could lead the state specifically to revisionist behavior. The major findings of the thesis are: (1) an ethnically heterogeneous society, political instability, and incongruence between ethnonational and state boundaries raise the likelihood of nationalistic rivalry; (2) nationalistic rivalry disproportionately increases revisionist behavior through the nationalist mobilization of society, in contrast to other rivalries and non-rivalries; (3) nationalism motivated by transborder ethnic groups is more revisionist-prone than nationalism framed by territorial statehood, only in dyads where the former targets the latter; (4) nuclear deterrence does not reduce the probability of revisionist war within nationalistic rivalry contrary to conventional nuclear deterrence theory; and (5) joint democracy, economic interdependence, and intergovernmental organizations do not decrease revisionist behavior within nationalistic rivalry.
